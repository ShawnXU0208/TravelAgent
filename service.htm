				  With the all the stresses of actually going on holiday can bring we’ve tried to make 
				  insurance an issue that you don’t need to worry about. We want you to enjoy your
				   adventure, after all it is a holiday and a break to get away not worry about if 
				   something goes wrong. We have put into one little package all the problems that 
				   can occur so we worry not you. You can either go for an outside company or add 
				   our option on when you talk to us. We offer a great rate of $5 per person per day.

			      Although our products are an all-inclusive trip with travel and accommodation many 
			      people enjoy to have a few extra days at the beginning or end of their trip to 
			      explore the area. In this case we can organise a rental vehicle for you whether 
			      it be a small or large vehicle we look after you’re every need and get the vehicle 
			      you desire. A rental vehicle gives you flexibility and the ability to travel when 
			      and where you want, we believe you should get the full enjoyment and discovery of 
			      the area where you are.
