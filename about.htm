				Travel Booker started one day when the owner, Carl, was looking 
				for a trip to take his family on. He visited many sites and stores 
				but only found what he wanted by calling the company’s in the specific 
				country directly, he thought there has to be a better way and that’s where
				 his idea came about. From gaining different and private trips to the 
				 big external company’s travel booker is able to offer trips for all 
				 sizes and styles. It then developed as the need for more requirements 
				 for a trip grew and Carl noticed that there was no group packages on 
				 the market for what he desired. He then created the all in one package
				  which is what we offer today to make a holiday easy and simply process for you.
